 * This file is automatically generated by 'yii message' command.

 * You may modify this file by translating the extracted messages.
 *
 * Each array element represents the translation (value) of a message (key).
 * If the value is empty, the message is considered as not translated.

 * enclosed between a pair of '@@' marks.

 * Message string can be used with plural forms format. Check i18n section
 * of the guide for details.
